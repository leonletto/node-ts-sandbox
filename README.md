# Test your Typescript Code in a simple Nodejs Environment 

## Summary

I wanted and small environment I could use to copy my functions into and run them without having to build a whole React App.

This is it.  Basic Functionality with nothing special but Node and TypeScript.

I tried to set it up with a sensible example of proper TypeScript usage.

## Features

I'll Probably add more demos but Initially I have a basic Array Transform one which I like:

Put your functions in the functions file(s), export them and use them.  The output will come from node.

Have fun and send me a pull request ( or e-mail ) with suggestions.
